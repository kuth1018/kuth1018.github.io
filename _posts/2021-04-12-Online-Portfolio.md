# Cover Letter

I have five years of experience developing android, iOS mobile applications. My professional skills perfectly align programming job.
<br>
  I earned two bachelor's degrees from Kyung Hee University, Computer Engineering and Electronics and Radio Engineering. My first career started with the medical IT company. I developed software to assist treatment in the hospital and provided software to more than 50 institutions including university and general hospitals. I also successfully led the project by participating in many medical conferences and exhibitions.
<br>
  In my second career, I was a responsible and reliable developer as a key member of SD Enternet's mobile game development team. My role was to write native code using C++ and run it on Android mobile apps using JNI. I customized the applications to work on iOS as well as Android, and developed various services using open API functions provided by Google, Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, I provided services to over 100,000 gamers in five countries without any problems. After successfully finishing the project in the SD Enternet, I was promoted to team leader and proceeded with the new project. I communicated with the game design, app design team and carried out the project smoothly.
<br>
  Recently, I am working on personal projects using React and Javascript because I am interested in not only native applications, also web and hybrid applications. I believe my expertises of works and interest will contribute to new success as a member of new job.
